kubectl run IMAGE_NAME --image=IMAGE_TO_BE_USED --dry-run=[CLIENT/SERVER/NONE] -o yaml
- this will create a sample yaml file that we can
use to create an actual yaml file from scratch.
- Server will run it
on the cluster but will immediately remove it; this is useful
for figuring out missing values because it will spit out an error.
- Client will not run it but will only show the YAML

COMMAND > filename.extension
- this will output the text output onto a file
on your current directory.
-Example: kubectl run IMAGE_NAME --dry-run=[CLIENT/SERVER/NONE] -o yaml > filename.extension
