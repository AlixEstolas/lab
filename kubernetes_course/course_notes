Containers
 - mini-VM that has all the packages needed to run a single application

 Virtual Machine
 - self-explanatory but in this context the containers are run in these virtual machines in a many-to-one relationship
 (many containers : one VM)

 Docker
 - allows developers to containerize an application so that it can run on any computer without needing
 any setup aside from Docker's

 Load Balancing
 - it allowed a cluster of virtual machines to have unique processes so that not all of them are
 working on the same user request for example.

 Managing Clusters
 - was a hassle pre-Kubernetes because each VM had its own operating system needed specifically for
 each container.

 Kubernetes
 - Allowed an easy way to give instructions to a cluster such as: when to scale up, when to scale down,
 what is the maximum size, what is the minimum size, etc. It also provided its own load balancer.
